Corpsecaster Mage	B	cube	Creature – Human Warlock 	116	B	1B	DeathtouchNEWLINEWhen Corpsecaster Mage enters, if you cast it, target creature card in your graveyard gains arise until end of turn. Its arise cost is equal to its mana cost. (Exile that card from your graveyard and pay its arise cost: Create a token that’s a copy of it except it’s a black Zombie in addition to its other types, has no mana cost, and can’t block. Arise only as a sorcery.)	2/1		normal	MC25		!design Matt
