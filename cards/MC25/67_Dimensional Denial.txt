Dimensional Denial	U	cube	Instant	67	U	1UU	Counter target spell.NEWLINEIf you countered a spell with mana value 2 or less this way, manifest dread. (Look at the top two cards of your library, then put one onto the battlefield face down as a 2/2 creature and the other into your graveyard. Turn it face up any time for its mana cost if it’s a creature card.)			normal	MC25		!Community: Trewq
